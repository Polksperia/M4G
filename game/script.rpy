    show Unknown at right

    s "Oh, speaking of work. We've received your letter of resignation from the Magic☆Girls Program"

    g "What do you mean \"Speaking of work\"? Don't just change the subject"

    s "This is your 1 week notice!"

    g "Oh."

    g "Well, great! It's been great working with you—"

    "Not really"

    g "—but I think it's time for both of us to move on"

    "And I can finally transition, go to college, and live a normal life" 

    s "You remember that I can read your mind right!"

    g "Yes."

    g "And I wish you would STOP doing that"

    g "And WHY did you wake me up at 6 in the morning on a Sunday?"

    s "1 week notice."

    g "That doesn't mean anything to me"

    s "One week notice."

    g "Saying it over and over again doesn't make me understand it any better"

    s "Since we're lacking Magical☆Girls for the Magic☆Girls Program, we can't let you leave until the quota is filled!"

    g "Wait, but that's not fair! I submitted my letter of resignation! So are you just not gonna let me go?"

    s "Correct."

    g "You can't just do that! And why did you wait till the last week to tell me?"

    s "As I said, this is your 1 week notice."

    g "You know that I hate you, right?"

    s "Noted."

    g "Noted my ASS"

    s "You just have to train new Magical Girls! It's not that hard, it'll be fun."

    g "You don't even know what fun means!"

    s "Sure I do! Remember that one time you got swallowed by a giant spider?"

    ## show *CG of Georgie inside a giant spider*

    g "Of course that's fun TO YOU. You SICK FUCK"

    s "Was that not a fun experience for you then! You humans are so complicated."
    
    g "Just get to the point"

    s "Currently there are 4 likely candidates for the Magical☆Girl position. As the Top☆Magical☆Girl you should be a good senior and mentor your successor."

    g "And if I don't?"

    s "Then you will stay in The Program, Top☆Magical☆Girl."

    g "Okay, well, I didn't know what I expected"

    g "You're not really giving me any choices here"

    s "Yes, I am. You have the choice of mentoring your successors or stay. That's a choice."

    g "Nevermind. So I need to teach some brats to earn my freedom right?"

    s "You make it sound like being the Top☆Magical☆Girl is a burden and not a privilege."

    g "Yeah, when YOU'RE running it! You're a TYRANT!"

    s "Don't say that, it's upsetting :("

    g "How did you convey an emoticon in speech AS A SWORD?"

    s "You start training the successors today."

    g "Today?!"

    s "Correct. At 7 AM."

    g "7?!"

    g "At least give me more time to prepare than just AN HOUR!"

    s "Hm..."

    s "How about \two\ hours?"

    g "Tyrant."

    s "Tomorrow then?"

    g "I guess that's the best I can hope from you"

    s "Perfect."

    s "See? I'm not a tyrant."

    g "Great. I'm going back to sleep"

    s "..."

    g "..."

    s "..."

    g "What? Go away!"

    s "You have a mission, Top☆Magical☆Girl."
